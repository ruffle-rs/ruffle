    } but you can always use these shortcuts instead:

error-file-protocol =
    It appears you are running Ruffle on the "file:" protocol.

    Instead, we invite you to setup a local server or either use the web demo or the desktop application.
error-javascript-config =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue due to an incorrect JavaScript configuration.
    If you are the server administrator, we invite you to check the error details to find out which parameter is at fault.
    You can also consult the Ruffle wiki for help.
error-wasm-not-found =
    Ruffle failed to load the required ".wasm" file component.
    If you are the server administrator, please ensure the file has correctly been uploaded.
    If the issue persists, you may need to use the "publicPath" setting: please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.
error-wasm-mime-type =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to initialize.
    This web server is not serving ".wasm" files with the correct MIME type.
    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.

    Ruffle cannot parse the requested file.
    The most likely reason is that the requested file is not a valid SWF.
error-swf-fetch =
    Ruffle failed to load the Flash SWF file.
    The most likely reason is that the file no longer exists, so there is nothing for Ruffle to load.
    Try contacting the website administrator for help.
error-swf-cors =
    Ruffle failed to load the Flash SWF file.
    Access to fetch has likely been blocked by CORS policy.
    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.

    Ruffle failed to load the required ".wasm" file component.
    Access to fetch has likely been blocked by CORS policy.
    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.

    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.
error-wasm-download =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to initialize.
    This can often resolve itself, so you can try reloading the page.
    Otherwise, please contact the website administrator.
error-wasm-disabled-on-edge =
    Ruffle failed to load the required ".wasm" file component.
    To fix this, try opening your browser's settings, clicking "Privacy, search, and services", scrolling down, and turning off "Enhance your security on the web".
    This will allow your browser to load the required ".wasm" files.
    If the issue persists, you might have to use a different browser.
error-wasm-unsupported-browser =
    The browser you are using does not support the WebAssembly extensions Ruffle requires to run.
    Please switch to a supported browser.
    You can find a list of supported browsers on the Wiki.
error-javascript-conflict =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to initialize.
    It seems like this page uses JavaScript code that conflicts with Ruffle.
    If you are the server administrator, we invite you to try loading the file on a blank page.
error-javascript-conflict-outdated = You can also try to upload a more recent version of Ruffle that may circumvent the issue (current build is outdated: {$buildDate}).
error-csp-conflict =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to initialize.
    This web server's Content Security Policy does not allow the required ".wasm" component to run.
    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.
error-unknown =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to display this Flash content.
