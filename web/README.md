# ruffle-web

![Test Web](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/workflows/Test%20Web/badge.svg)

ruffle-web is a Wasm version of Ruffle, intended for use by either
using the `ruffle-selfhosted` or `ruffle-extension` NPM packages.

This project is split into two parts: The actual Flash player written in Rust,
and a javascript interface to it. Most of the time, you will be building the
actual rust part through the npm build scripts.

## Using ruffle-web

Please refer to our wiki for instructions on how to use Ruffle either
[on your own website](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle#web),
or as a [browser extension](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle#browser-extension).

## How it works

We compile Ruffle down to a Wasm ([WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) binary, which will be loaded
into web pages either deliberately (installing the selfhosted package onto the website), or injected
by users as a browser extension.

By default we will detect and replace any embedded Flash content on websites with the Ruffle player
(we call this "polyfilling"), but this can be configured by the website. This means that Ruffle is an
"out of the box" solution for getting Flash to work again; include Ruffle and it should just workâ„¢.

For rendering the content, we prefer to use [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
WebGL is very accurate, hardware-accelerated and very fast, but is not universally supported.
Additionally, many privacy related browsers or extensions will disable WebGL by default.
For this reason, we include a fallback using [the canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

## Building from source

### Requirements

Before you are able to build this project, you must first install a few dependencies:

#### Rust

Follow the instructions [to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine.

We do not have a Minimum Supported Rust Version policy. If it fails to build, it's likely you may need
to update to the latest stable version of rust. You may run `rustup update` to do this (if you installed
rust using the above instructions).

For the compiler to be able to output WebAssembly, an additional target has to be added to it: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

#### Java

Follow the instructions [to install OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/20/) on your machine.

We do not have a specific Java support policy. Any Java version that supports running the AS3 compiler
should work. Additionally, headless JREs should also work.

#### Node.js

Follow the instructions to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine.

We recommend using the currently active LTS 22, but we do also run tests with current Node.js 23.

Note that npm 7 or newer is required. It should come bundled with Node.js 15 or newer, but can be upgraded with older Node.js versions using `npm install -g npm` as root/Administrator.

#### wasm-bindgen

<!-- Be sure to also update the wasm-bindgen-cli version in `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `web/Cargo.toml`. -->

This can be installed with `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.99`. Be sure to install this specific version of `wasm-bindgen-cli` to match the version used by Ruffle.

#### Binaryen

This is optional, used to further optimize the built WebAssembly module.
Some ways to install Binaryen:

-   download one of the [prebuilt releases](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases/)
-   using your Linux distribution's package manager (`sudo apt install binaryen`, `sudo dnf install binaryen`)
-   from [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/binaryen)
-   from [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/binaryen)
-   [compile it yourself](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen#building)

Just make sure the `wasm-opt` program is in `$PATH`, and that it works.

#### Optional features

##### `jpegxr`

The release version of the extension is compiled with `jpegxr`.
To enable it, set the env `CARGO_FEATURES="jpegxr"`.

Windows dependencies:

- Install LLVM and add the full path of its `bin` folder (example: `C:\Program Files\LLVM-18.1.6\bin`) to your env `PATH`.
- Set env `LIBCLANG_PATH` with the same `bin` folder.

### Building

In this project, you may run the following commands to build all packages:

-   `npm install`
    -   This will install every dependency for every package.
    -   Run this every time you pull in new changes, otherwise you may be missing a package and the build will fail.
-   `npm run build`
    -   This will build the wasm binary and every node package (notably selfhosted and extension).
    -   Output will be available in the `dist/` folder of each package (for example, `./packages/selfhosted/dist`).
    -   You may also use `npm run build:debug` to disable Webpack optimizations and activate the (extremely verbose) ActionScript debugging output.
    -   There is `npm run build:dual-wasm` as well, to build a second WebAssembly module that makes use of some WebAssembly extensions,
        potentially resulting in better performance in browsers that support them, at the expense of longer build time.
    -   `npm run build:repro` enables reproducible builds. Note that this also requires a `version_seal.json`, which is not provided in the normal Git repository - only specially-marked reproducible source archives. Running this without a version seal will generate one based on the current state of your environment.

From here, you may follow the instructions to [use Ruffle on your website](packages/selfhosted/README.md),
run a demo locally with `npm run demo`, or [install the extension in your browser](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle#browser-extension).

### Testing

There are two parts of tests to this project:
- Regular node tests, ran through `npm run test`. You must have built everything first as above. These have no special requirements.
- Browser based tests, ran through `npm run wdio` with extra arguments as below. These take longer to run and require some setup.

## Browser Based Tests
There are full integration tests that require a browser to run. We don't make any assumptions about your environment, and so you must specify it yourself.

To run these tests, first build the project as above, then use `npm run wdio -- --arg1 --arg2` etc.

### Local Browsers
These are additive - you can specify multiple at the same time. You must have the given browsers installed locally though, or it will fail.

- `--chrome` for Chrome
- `--firefox` for Firefox
- `--edge` for Edge

### BrowserStack (Mobile Browsers)
To run tests on mobile devices on BrowserStack, pass the `--browserstack` argument.
We also have our "minimum supported desktop browsers" available too, by additionally passing `--oldVersions`.

You will need a BrowserStack account (Maintainers may contact @Dinnerbone on Discord for an invite to the Ruffle team),
and set the appropriate values to `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

### Other Options
Pass `--headless` to hide the browser windows. This is useful and recommended in almost every case, but if you want to debug why a test fails then it's very useful to not pass this.

Pass `--spec <name>` to filter a test based on name. For example, `--spec external_interface` to tests with `external_interface` in the path.


### Testing tips!
If debugging a failing test, use `await browser.pause(100000);` in the test file to pause it, and don't start the test with `--headless`.
That way you can actually see what's happening, and manually get involved to debug it.

## Contributing

Please follow the [general contribution guidelines for Ruffle](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

In addition to those, we ask that you ensure that you pass all tests with `npm run test`, and check the automatic code
linting & styler by running `npm run format` before you commit.

Where possible, please add tests to all new functionality or bug fixes that you contribute.

Thank you!
