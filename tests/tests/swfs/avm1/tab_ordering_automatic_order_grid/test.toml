# This test verifies the basic behavior of automatic tab ordering using a grid of movie clips.
# The grid is 5x4 and clips are placed randomly on it.
# Each clip has a random depth and position in the SWF file.
#
# This test shows that the order is not dependent on the depth or position in the SWF file,
# but is mainly dependent on the position on the screen.
