# This test has two issues per the PR that introduced it:
# 1. Precision limits that are specific to the chosen radix are not properly emulated
# 2. Flash produces occasional and intermittent corruption in the resulting 0 padding; usually manifesting as `x`, `W`, or `°` characters
# Issue 2 means the output.txt does not consistently match what Flash actual produces, but unless we emulate the corruption, Ruffle's output should be consistent.
