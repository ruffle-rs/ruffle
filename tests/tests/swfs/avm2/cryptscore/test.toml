# This file tests that our Math.random() implementation works
# correctly for some weird memory-obfuscation logic.
# Flash Player's `Math.random()` implementation generates
# a limited range of `Number`s in the range [0.0, 1.0), which
# allows this swf to correctly compute the original value
# (instead of a very close value due to rounding).
