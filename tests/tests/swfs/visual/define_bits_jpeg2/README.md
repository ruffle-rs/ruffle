This test verifies various images embedded into a SWF.
If you need to add more images, it's better to copy this test than to extend it.

List of images:

* `01_image.gif` – standard GIF,
* `02_image_i.gif` – GIF with interlacing,
* `03_image_420.jpeg` – JPEG with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling,
* `04_image_422.jpeg` – JPEG with 4:2:2 chroma subsampling,
* `05_image_440.jpeg` – JPEG with 4:4:0 chroma subsampling,
* `06_image_444.jpeg` – JPEG with 4:4:4 chroma subsampling,
* `07_image_ac.jpeg` – JPEG with arithmetic coding,
* `08_image_cmyk.jpeg` – JPEG with CMYK color coding,
* `09_image_fi.jpeg` – JPEG with Fast Integer DCT,
* `10_image_fp.jpeg` – JPEG with Floating-Point DCT,
* `11_image_low_quality.jpeg` – JPEG with low quality,
* `12_image_meta.jpeg` – JPEG with additional metadata,
* `13_image_np.jpeg` – non-progressive JPEG,
* `14_image_rm8.jpeg` – JPEG with restart markers, 8 MCU rows,
