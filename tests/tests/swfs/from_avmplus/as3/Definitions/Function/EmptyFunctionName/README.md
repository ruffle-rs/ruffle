In order to compile the test, unpack `source.tar.xz` here and compile normally.

Sources are archived because some filenames have to differ only in case, and
this would break the whole Ruffle repository on Windows.

It also means that if you're on Windows, you have to enable case sensitivity
in order to compile this test.
