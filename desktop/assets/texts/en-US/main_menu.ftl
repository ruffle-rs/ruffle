# A note on ellipsis: they indicate when an action won't immediately happen, but needs more information from the user.
# For example, "Open File..." won't open a file, it'll ask the user to choose a file and *then* open the file.
# Whereas "Close" or "About" wouldn't need any information, they'd immediately happen as soon as you click it.
# In general, if clicking the thing immediately does that thing, no ellipsis. If it asks for more information, ellipsis.
# This is the case for English, but other languages may have other rules or ways of showing this.

# Some items may be also be duplicated here, like "About Ruffle" in the menu and "About Ruffle" elsewhere as the header of the about menu.
# This is because some languages may use different wording for one or the other, especially with things like capitalisation.
