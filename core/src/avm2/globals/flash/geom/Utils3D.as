         * Interpolates the orientation of an object toward a position. The `pointTowards()`
         * method combines the functionality of the `Matrix3D.pointAt()` and
         * `Matrix3D.interpolateTo()` methods.
         * 
         * The `pointTowards()` method allows for in-place modification to the orientation.
         * It decomposes the Matrix3D of the display object and replaces the rotation
         * elements by ones that make a percent turn toward the position of the target. The
         * object can make an incremental turn toward the target while still moving in its
         * own direction. The consecutive calls to the `pointTowards()` followed by a
         * translation method can produce the animation of an object chasing or following a
         * moving target. First point the object a percent point toward the target, then
         * incrementally move the object along an axis.
         * 
         * @param   percent A Number between 0 and 1 that incrementally turns the object
         * toward the target.
         * @param   mat The Matrix3D property of the object that is transformed.
         * @param   pos The world-relative position of the target object. World-relative
         * defines the transformation of the object relative to the world space and
         * coordinates, where all objects are positioned.
         * @param   at  The object-relative vector that defines where the display object is
         * pointing. Object-relative defines the transformation of the object relative to the
         * object space, the object's own frame of reference and coordinate system. Default
         * value is (0,0,-1).
         * @param   up  The object-relative vector that defines "up" for the display object.
         * If the object is drawn looking down from the above, the +z axis is its "up"
         * vector. Object-relative defines the transformation of the object relative to the
         * object space, the object's own frame of reference and coordinate system. Default
         * value is (0,-1,0).
         * @return  A modified version of the Matrix3D object specified in the second
         * parameter. To transform the display object using the `pointTowards()` method, set
         * the Matrix3D property of the display object to the returned Matrix3D object.
