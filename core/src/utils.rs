/// A trait indicating that `Self` has `Inner` as an initial prefix.

/// A field prefix is the first field in a struct that has the same address as the struct
/// in the memory. If a struct has a prefix field, we can reinterpret the struct pointer
/// as a pointer to the field.
///
/// Implementing this trait provides various methods to cast `Self` references to `Inner`
/// references, which can be used e.g. to implement OOP-style class hierarchies.
///
/// This trait can be automatically derived on `repr(C)` structs with `#[derive(HasPrefixField)]`.
///
/// # Safety
/// - `Self` must have a field of type `Inner` at the start of its layout;
/// - `Self` must not impose additional safety invariants on the `Inner` prefix;
/// - The methods of this trait should not be overriden;
/// - Any layout constraints that can't be checked by the type-system should
///   be checked by assertions in the `ASSERT_PREFIX_FIELD` constant.
